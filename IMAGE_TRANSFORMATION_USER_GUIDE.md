## ❓ Troubleshooting

### **"Transformation doesn't look right"**

- Use better source photo (well-lit, clear)

### **"Insufficient credits"**
- Check credit balance (top right of Media Library)
- Purchase more credits
- Use lower-credit transformations (2 credits vs 3 credits)

### **"Upload failed"**
- File size must be under 10MB
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
- Compress large images first

### **"Transform button not appearing"**
- Only works on images (not videos)
- Hover over image in grid view
- Check that image is fully loaded
