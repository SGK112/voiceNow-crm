"The AI receptionist that handles your phone calls while Sintra handles your emails. Built for contractors who can't afford to miss $10K+ jobs."

## Competitive Moat

### What Sintra Can't Easily Copy:

5. **Industry positioning** - Already own "contractor voice AI"

### What We Do Better:
1. Voice sounds human (ElevenLabs)
2. Books appointments via phone
3. Handles objections in real-time
4. Built specifically for high-value calls
5. All-in pricing (not per-bot)

## SEO/Keyword Opportunities

Target searches where Sintra fails:
- "AI phone answering for contractors"

- "Voice AI for field services"
- "Never miss a call automation"
- "Phone answering bot for HVAC"

3. **Content marketing:** "Why Email Bots Won't Answer Your Phone"
